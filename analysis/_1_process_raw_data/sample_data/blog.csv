Crying Wolf (on The Wall Street),20170616,6 comments,{RD.} Salam Ramadan Dato Rocky.To me... the first thing Apandi or Najib need to do... if they really wanted to show that nothing was wrong in 1MDB is to declassified all reports that have been OSAed.,"{M. Bakri Musa} Few points to bear in mind so as to enlighten your readers as well as to put things in perspective. The DOJ lawsuit is a civil - not criminal - one. The pace of all civil suits in America is glacial, meaning, it is normal for it to take years before coming to trial. For another, the suit is againts the ASSETS, not inviduals. Of course those assets belong to someone, so indirectly it is a suit against their owners.  However if there is a criminal indictment initiated during the process, then the pace would hasten quickly as there is the axiom in law that justice delayed is justice denied. The only reason DOJ can ""campor tangan"" in the matter is because those funds to buy those assets flowed through American banks. Even if Low and Aziz and MO1 could smuggle all those millions in their suitcases and diplomatic puches through the airport, they could still get into trouble.  In America, all cash transactions exceeding $10,000 must be reported to the authorities. So you cannot escape. The central crux of the matter is this:  Where did all the money to acquire those properties come from?  In case of Jho Low one could concieveably believe it was family's wealth through years of hard work by his ancestors, as he claimed. For Reza Aziz?  Wealth from his father? A nondescript Malaysian army officer? Stepfather Najib, who had been government all his adult life? Mother Rosmah is the daugheter of a village school teacher from my kampung in NS. Look at the house where she was born! No weatlh to speak of. However if you believe that some Sheik in Saudi Araba was generous to give Reza hundreds of millions for no apparent reason, as he claimed, then there is some mangrove swamps in Lumut I can sell you.That my friend is the crux of the problem. Until someone can give a better explanation, I believe the DOJ version. Everything else is spin. ","{damansaraman} Assalammualaikum DatoTidak pernah dalam sejarah kita bertindak sebacul ini.

On 22nd April UMNO Malaysia again received two further cheques of RM50 million each.Individual cheques were also handed out to all UMNO and related BN divisions, for example Badan Perhubungan UMNO Negeri Pahang received RM15 million on 18th April and the following day, April 19th, UMNO Penang received RM5 million. Kelantan division received RM5 million on 10th April.Amongst the many other similar payments was RM5 million both the UMNO state party of Kedah and the MCA Selangor Liason Committee on 8th April and RM20 million to UMNO Selangor on April 24th.  UMNO Perak received its handout on April 29th of RM25 million with another five million each going to UMNO Selangor and the MCA Selangor Liason Committee again the following day.  Also on 30th April Johor UMNO received RM25 million, less than a week before the election.The UMNO womens’ divisions also received significant pay outs, signifying the party’s appreciation of the importance of ‘winning’ the female vote: Pergerakan Puteri UMNO Malaysia received a RM5 million cheque 27th February and Pergerakan Wanita UMNO Selangor RM1.1 million 22nd March and Wanita Barisan Nasional Selangor RM1 million on 17th May.Allied parties also received big money, for example the Liberal Democratic Party received RM1 million 5th April, the Malaysian Indian Congress received RM10 million on the 18th April and a further RM5 million 26th April. SUPP received RM2 million 20th March.  The previous year UPCO had received RM2 million, indeed over the election huge sums were dished out to Sabah and particularly Sarawak (of which more later).Saudi storySince all this money came from stolen public funds, borrowed at punishing rates of interest under false pretenses, the ultimate cost to the Malaysian taxpayer will be at least double the sums handed out in this exercise to buy votes for the ruling party, who was abusing its position in such a spectacular fashion.People are entitled to assume that a man who is willing to raid his country’s development fund, as well as the civil servant pension fund, the pilgrims’ fund, the farmers’ fund and doubtless other sources of public money, is unlikely to hesitate to attempt to bribe voters with a little of that money back in the form of payment for votes.","{Anonymous} If Najib has to keep stepping in to every ego driven mistake, it does serve any purpose to gave Ministers and government representative Chairmen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My Sabah, Our Sabah",20170503,1 comment,"{Tunku Aziz} Federations have a poor record of keeping states happily together for any length of time. The British union of England, Scotland and Wales is going through a stressful period and how much longer will Scotland remain in the family? Think of other federations that are now all but forgotten: The West Indian Federation, the East African Federation, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, to name a few. In their modern form,federations were a British invention, used as a simple expedient for washing their hands off a difficult imperial political problem.We in the Malay Peninsula should take pride in nurturing Sabah into a modern state, a far cry from the days when I was sent out to the then British North Borneo to teach at Sabah College.We have prepared them well and we must set them free if this is what the people of Sabah really want. A referendum supervised by an international team should decide the matter once and for all. The same goes for Sarawak.Let them leave the nest. Freedom is their birthright. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Period.If 1MDB had really paid $3.5 billion in ‘guarantee deposits’ to IPIC, as Najib continues to laughably claim, then Malaysia would never have lost the arbitration case and been forced to pay back the $1.2 billion that IPIC later bailed them out with.Instead, the court would have pointed out that the bail out was just a third of the up-front deposit and IPIC would actually still have over $2 billion of 1MDB’s money left.This is not what has happened.  The settlement involves an agreement by 1MDB to pay back the bail out money and to take over the responsibility for the remainder of its debts.It is therefore a concrete admission by Malaysia that it could not prove its claims that it had deposited a single cent let alone billions with IPIC.And that means that the money trails supplied by the DOJ investigations, showing instead that all the money was siphoned off into a bogus BVI account to pay for Jho Low, Rosmah and Khadem Al Qubaisi’s fun and frolics, has been confirmed by the settlement and not weakened.It is plain as daylight, yet this Minister of Disinformation is attempting to say the opposite. How stupid does he think people are in Malaysia?He is also asking people to believe that the payment is going to come from the ‘monetisation’ of non-existant ‘units’ that 1MDB also doesnt have, because all the PetroSaudi money was funnelled into another off-shore company (Good Star Limited) and stolen as well.Puad says we should believe his story because the PM’s office said it (just like they said IPIC received money which it didn’t).So, who is going to believe this illogical and mendacious fellow when he goes on to say that Najib won’t be touching taxpayer’s funds to repay the debt?Is there a single voter who believes that?","{Hantu Gigi Jarang} Rocky, for once, tenguklah balik bumi yang kau pijak dan langit yang kau junjung.

Views on the Malaysian economy: the kind of U-turn we'd like to see,20170213,2 comments,"{Mat Cendana} Look back at previous years' predictions and one will see that, in each and every year, there had been anal-ysts insisting Malaysia was going to face financial troubles. As in going down the drain. And they had colourful pie charts and tables to prove it.Sure, things had not been smooth. Especially at the height of 1MDB-related issues, the price of crude oil collapsing and the ringgit depreciating. But things look to have improved since then. Dollar's strength is still a concern to some, especially to companies with dollar-denominated debts. But we had gone through worse. And survived. We will, again.","{IT.Scheiss} I attended a talk by my remisier yesterday - a solidly pro-opposition man in a DAP stronghold - and he told us that the uncertain times of 2016 are over for Bursa Malaysia and the KL Composite Index, and that with the strong likelihood that the U.S. economy will recover and do well this year, that with GE 14 coming, the government will likely spend more on infrastructure development, such as the MRT, with gradually rising crude oil prices, growing demand for palm oil (especially for biodiesel) it is likely that the shares of export-oriented companies, the construction industry and the oil & gas industry including O&G service industries will likely pick up, so watch the movement of share prices in these industries.Whatever tariff measures the Trump administration may implement, however Malaysia's oil palm industry will not be affected especially where exports are to China and other countries besides the U.S.He also told us that shares of FGV are likely to recover and when they have recovered sufficiently, that is when Najib could call the elections.I also believe that with investments from China, including the building of the East Coast rail link, Malaysian industries and workers are bound to benefit from the collateral benefits.So unless World War III breaks out or something like that, the future looks promising for stock market investors and traders at least in 2017 and 2018.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you enter a country as a foreign labor, your mindset is that as a worker you'll have to listen to your boss. This will force you to blend in and assimilate and hence be a part of your adopted country. This happened to the Kerala descendant; he assimilated, helped out and pen his thoughts on the rights of the people in his younger days (and even now, in his blog), even gave the country a purpose and vision (Malaysia Boleh!). This also happened to the foreign labor we have today; within a few months upon arriving the Bangladeshi workers speak better Bahasa Malaysia than the Bangsar Malaysians (r intended).When you buy something, you expect to be able to tell the seller to do things for you because a customer is always right; the buyer is the master. Put this into the ""foreigner buys Malaysian land"" equation and you will eventually ask; might the bigger picture really be neocolonialism riding on globalization?Imagine you have a foreign worker who helps you with your restaurant business. One day your restaurant is visited by a wealthy man who comes from the same country as your worker.

Semoga segalanya semakin terang. ,"{Mat Cendana} If people say that ""too many"" projects in Malaysia are by the Chinese, then how many would be ""just right""? Among the realities that we are living with in the world right now is that China has the resources, as well as it being a major buyer of resources that it requires. We as the small fry must accept the realities and adapt accordingly to ensure that we too will benefit from situations. Or we can choose to be hostile and make things difficult for China's investors. There will be less of their companies coming in as a result. But will that be beneficial to us all?The fact that these China companies are willing to risk their capital, time and energy in Malaysia says something about their confidence in the country and its potentials. Sure, it may be better if the investments are more balanced. I'm very sure Najib would also be welcoming of companies from the US, Europe, Japan and Middle East coming in with big projects. In fact, I believe he will also welcome the Taliban should it want to come in with capital to develop some new port and township in Malaysia.Right now it's the Chinese who are willing to invest in a big way. Would be great if US and European companies were to come in too and counter-balance the Chinese. But they have their own problems, priorities and plans. They might do so in future but for now it's better that we try to make the best of what is on the table.Rather than scaremongering about China buying over Malaysia, the more productive thing to do is to monitor these companies.

Another BSI banker jailed for laundering,20161216,6 comments,"{Cash is king} ""Investigations in Malaysia into 1MDB were first ordered by Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is chairman of the fund's advisory body.""But sorry. The person who first ordered the investigation appoint new attorney general and throw the case away.And also sorry for the auditor general report need to be buried because its not safe for public consumption.Perhaps this is the example of muslim country who follow islamic teaching in handling corruption issue.Singapore is liberal and secular country. Do take note.Demi agama bangsa dan negara... *wink*","{Gopal Raj Kumar} I love the way in which the opposition converts any Singapore government action against banks and bankers as being reflective of 1MDB's presumed guilt by US authorities. Singapore is no independent state. It jumps each time the US asks it to. Singapore has no moral standards when it comes to banking. It has been the centre for drug and arms trafficking money, for stolen money and money siphoned out of the accounts of governments in developing countries.Suddenly it has turned the screws on the smaller players for one reason or the other to show the world it is cleaning up its act in regards to black money.The problem with 1MDB and any of its faults (none of which anyone has provided a legal explanation for to conclude it is criminal or illegal) is that no one has ever taken the time to ask if Jho Lo is in fact a part of 1MDB. Like Golaman Sachs he too is a feeder who went overboard and failed to perform on his commitments. That does not make 1MDB of any of its officers corrupt or its activities illegal.","{xnakdedak} 'Investigations in Malaysia into 1MDB were first ordered by Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is chairman of the fund's advisory body.'Prime Minister Najib Razak....Who then told his macai to delete the PAC evidence that proved that 1 billion was siphoned to Jho Low.Who OSA-ed the AG Report showing that $7 billion is gone.Who then put a hand-picked barua in place to reject the MACC's prosecution of...HIMSELF!Ohhhh Latuk, Latuk, you're so cute.As your only reader, I'm deeply impressed : ) ","{Hantu Gigi Jarang} For God's sake, write truthfully la..",{mahiaddin} fantasi 1mdb kononnya semua betulyang taram jubo dikata banduan politik pulakagak2 perut siapa yang dah pecah di dalam tanah tu,"{Hantu Gigi Jarang} What is money laundering Rocky?
