1-[X]-Complete party for each leader, najib should belong to UMNO instead of BN
2-[X]-Complete parent party for each party, and remove duplicates
3-[X]-Use NLTK for our data
4-[X]-Fix cant plot keyword cloud for chinese, now is only display square char
5-[X]-Refactor code in _3_label_semantic, because code duplication detected
6-[X]-Redirect english.new.json to english.json in step 2?
7-[X]-Generate new analysis results using the 13Marchlatest.txt files in D:\code\github\TCLCPhase2\keywords\polarity based on scraped results from chinaPress and Sin Chiew
8-[]-The analysis code should only run ONLY ON the comments from the scraped results from Malaysiakini, Sinchiew and CHinaPress facebook page. Don't run on the post itself as the current text matching is too simplistic and will yield inaccurate results for a post with many sentences.
9-[X]-Add some qualifying words  no, not, don’t, won’t, shan’t in front of all the positive keywords and if they match, count as negative and make sure you don’t accidentally count as positive.
